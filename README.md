Trying to solve a ticket. Scenarior: entire online banking is down, no one can access/login to the computers. The entire network just got a huge update. Since the last thing that came to mine is the update, the best scenario is try the previous version and reset the computers. They called back and the systems are running. Resolved the ticket and noted the what happened and how it was fixed.

Dealing with a laptop top turning on, there could be different types of situations. It would be best to start with the easy ones like a new charging chord or, it could be the battery. Took a new charging chord and saw the laptop was charging. Tried the power button and worked. Resolved the ticket.
